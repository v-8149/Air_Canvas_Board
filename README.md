The air canvas board project involves controlling drawing on a virtual canvas using hand gestures, but identifying precise finger movements and tracking them in real time can be challenging. The solution uses **MediaPipe** for accurate hand landmark detection and tracking. **OpenCV** handles webcam input, visualizes the drawings, and processes user gestures like color selection. Finally, **NumPy** helps with efficient array operations, ensuring smooth performance for real-time interaction.
